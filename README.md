# virtual-pet

Project Name: Virtual Pet

This is a program that allows you to take care of a virtual pet.  You are able to name your pet as well as feed, hydrate and put your pet to sleep.  Every time you take an action, your pet's hunger, thirst or energy levels will change.  The game will end when your pet is too hungry, too tired or too thirsty. 

This was created as an assignment in the We Can Code It coding bootcamp in Cleveland, Ohio.
